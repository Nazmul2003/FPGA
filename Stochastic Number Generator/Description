This project is made using verilog only.
First I have designed one LFSR (new msb is the XOR of the lsb and 1st bit).
Then, I have connected a 4-bit comparator to compare the data in LFSR and an external input.
The current output, the last output and the second last output of the comparator are fed to a 3-bit AND gate (D-Flipflops are used here).
